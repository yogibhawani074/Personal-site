  <h2>a Public Health Practioner.</h2>
  <p>Today, we are quite attached to the current model of the health system. It needs to re-look because it's not working.</p>
  <p>The whole medicine and the approach to modern medicine have come when the problem was only with contagious diseases.</p>
  <p>For instance, How to treat the plague? Nobody ever thought of diabetes or hypertension or a cardiac problem or mental problem.</p> 
  <p>They never even considered those things that did not exist on their radar. In their radar, only infectious diseases did exist.</p>
  <p>So, this whole medical system evolved from the need to handle infectious diseases in those times.</p>
  <p>But today we have come to a place where people are on self-help. That is, they manufacture their own diseases.</p>
  <p>So, they need another system of medicine. Another way to approach completely.</p>
  <p>The symptomatic treatment may become irrelevant after some time because we are just gathering data and processing it and giving an answer.</p>
  <p>This is a machine that will be able to do better than any human being because it can process much faster and much better, not miss anything. 
  <p>Tomorrow artificial intelligence will make diagnoses by itself and treat us by itself. So it is time the young doctors who are coming up now should focus on how you should be able to look beyond the symptoms. This is what Integrative health care practices about. </p>
